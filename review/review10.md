# Review10: Week of Mar 31

## Testing
1. Define functional or black box testing.
2. Define structural or white box testing.
3. State three differences between functional and structural testing.
4. What is the state explosion problem? Explain in the context of testing. What strategy can be adopted to tackle this problem?
5. What is random testing?
6. What are the advantages of random testing?
7. What are the disadvantages of random testing?
8. What are independent testable features? Give example from a multifunction calculator.
9. What are representative values? 
10. What are equivalent classes? How can we select representatives from equivalent classes? 
11. What are the heuristics for prioritizing tests?

## Heuristics for testing
1. What are the heuristics for deteting bug in code? State three and explain in detail.
2. What is Gunes Koru's heuristic for detecting bugs by inspecting less code? Try to justify why the Koru method might work.
3. What are different inspection methods used for detecting bug in code? State and explain each.
5. Define all pairs. Given limitations in human cognitive ability and finite testing budgets, justify why all-pairs might be an interesting test strategy.
6. Show the error in the following output for all pairs of 5 booleans. Explain why it is an error and fix the error. (Note: in the following "0" means "dont care")

    ````
    ((2 2 1 1 1)
     (2 1 2 2 2)
     (1 2 2 1 2) 
     (1 1 1 2 1)
     (0 2 2 2 2)
     (0 1 1 1 2))
