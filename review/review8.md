## Effort Estimation

1. What is the Delphi (expert) method of software effort estimation? When would you want to estimate using Delphi method?
2. What is the algorithmic (model based) method of software effort estimation? When would you want to estimate using algorithmic method?
2. What is overestimation? What are it's effect on development?
3. What is underestimation? What are it's effect on development?
4. State two problems with effort estimation and explain them.
5. State three strategies to solve the problems with effort estimation.
4. State three tactics to solve the problems with effort estimation.
5. State the methods to solve the problems with effort estimation.
6. What is feature maturity? What kind of organizations are suitable for adopting this strategy?
7. What are the characteristics of the big bang effort estimation?
8. What are the properties of the spiral model? How does spiral model deal with the risk management issue?
9. What kind of developer and/or development strategy is suited for leveraging of many bangs strategy?
10. What are the scenarios that facilitate the no estimation strategy? When is the case that it is not suitable to adopt no estimation?
11. Very briefly explain the following approaches to effort estimation: Big bang, can't use Delphi models, should use algorithmic models like COCOMO
12. You have to build a very large scale system for the government, which requires you to provide your estimate to the government for the funding. What kind of effort estimation strategy would you use and why? 

## Planning Poker
1. What are the properties of planning poker? 
2. What kind of software development strategy uses planning poker?
3. What is the purpose of using planning poker?

## COCOMO
1. For each of the following pre-defined values in the COCOMO model, explain whether an increase in their individual values would result in a faster or slower development:
    - Analyst Capability
    - Multi site development
    - Use of software tools
    - Product complexity
2. COCOMO is a parametric effort estimation method. Define parametric methods, using COCOMO as the example.

## Case Based Reasoning
1. In what sense is case-based reasoning NOT a parametric method? When might case-based work better than parametric methods?
2. Define MRE.
3. An analyst offers a single MRE as the estimate of an error a project. What are the drawbacks with that single number?
4. What are ways to generate expected ranges of estimates.
5. From the following dataset, guesstimate the unknown value of Khours for the last data row with all the independent values given using 1 nearest neighbor. Assume that the new project does multisite development, use some, but not lots, of software tools, the product is very complex. Show all of your work.
