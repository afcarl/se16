# Review3: Week of Jan 28

## Typed languages
1. Briefly explain compile-time type inference concept of programming languages. Given an example. 
2. How might compile time type inference reduce error rates in Software Engineering?

## Architectures
3. Define "software architecture"? Give three examples.
4. Project1 has a "good" architecture and project2 has a "bad" architecture. What might we observe
in one of those projects and not in the other?

## Architectures: Case studies
4. What is the net-neutrality rule in a packet switching network architecture?
5. What advantage does the distributed network has over centralized network?
6. Blackboards:
     1. What are the properties of the Blackboard architecture?
     1. State an application where the Blackboard architecture can be used and justify.
	 1. Some say that "publish-subscribe" might be useful for blackboards. What is "Publish subscribe" and how might it be useful for blackboards?
	 
7. Layered systems
      1. What are layered systems?
      2. Give an example of a layered system architecture and list it's layers.
      3. What limitations does the LAMP architecture has? How does MEAN try to solve them?
9. CRUD: What is the CRUD (SCRUD) concept? Where is it used?
10. Below are two system designs, one hides the internal details of modules and the other doesn't. Which one do you prefer, why? (Hint: [David Parnas on modular design](http://se16.unbox.org/_pdf/kwic.pdf))

## Java
1. What is the java virtual machine and why is it so important?

## Prolog, Erlang, Elixir (warning: hard questions)
1. Compare the scoping rules of standard languages (that support nested blocks)  and clause=based languages
   like Prolog. 
2. Who created Erlang? What problem did Erlang solve? How does the scoping rules of Erlang clauses
   simplify concurrency?
3. What is Elixir? How is it implemented?
