<p>Y'all yearning to be learning? Me too!</p>



<P>Education is the not the filling of a pail, but the <b>lighting of a fire.</b><br>
  -- W.Yeats</p><br>


<P>If the world merely lived up to our wildest dreamings, what a dull place it would be. Happily...<br>
  -- Me<p>
  

<p>Learn why the world wags and what
wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can
never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by,
never fear or distrust, and never dream of
regretting. Learning is the only thing for
you. <b>Look what a lot of things there are to
learn.</b><br>
  -- T.H. White (The Once and Future King)</p>
