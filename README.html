<p>Y'all yearning to be learning? Me too!</p>


<P>Education is the not the filling of a pail, but the <b>lighting of a fire</b><br>-- William Butler Yeats</p>

<P>If the world merely lived up to our wildest dreamings, what a dull place it would be. Happily...<br>

  The best thing for being sad, (replied Merlin,
beginning to puff and blow) is to learn
something. That's the only thing that never
  fails. 
  You may grow old and trembling in your
anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to
the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only
love, you may see the world about you devastated by
evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the
  sewers of baser minds. 
  There is only one thing for
it then- to learn. Learn why the world wags and what
wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can
never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by,
never fear or distrust, and never dream of
regretting. Learning is the only thing for
you. <b>Look what a lot of things there are to
learn.</b><br>
  -- T.H. White, The Once and Future King</p>
