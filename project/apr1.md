# Apr1 Project 

[TOC]

# Goals

1. To get agile as soon as possible. Make as much changes as possible to your system, as soon as possible.
2. To test your evaluation methods, as soon as possible. Then fix them. Then run them all again,
3. To generate the data needed for the April project.


## What NOT to Do

+ Do not wait for end of the month before starting this work.
+ Get agile asap.
  Do not assume as much work done as early as possible to find what is missing from your currently
  implementation.


## What to Hand in

To our [submission spreadsheet](https://goo.gl/kOunui)
paste in a _shortened_ [^shorter] url to a README.md file with _labeled_ links to:

1. Your repo's issues pages.
2. Your repo's milestone pages.
3. Your repo's
   [contributor's page](https://github.com/opensciences/opensciences.github.io/graphs/contributors).
4. A pdf version of your report, making a principled case that one of
   your three methods is better than one of the others. This report should:
      + Be laid out in the same way as the January report.
      + Be five to ten pages long (no longer).
      + Go back to your January report
      + Describe your evaluation plan you used to  assess your three methods.
      + Describe your new results in the context of the data. 
      + Using informative graphics, report the results. Note that such infographics should tell
        a clear and succinct story (so not graphics for graphics sake). And all figures
        should be discussed in the text (so no orphan figures).
5. [From the presentation sign-up page](https://goo.gl/m8j438)
grab a slot to present your material. Your groups' talk will be 20 minutes long
(including question time). Your talk should overview and introduce your project
then try to convince the audience, using evidence that you collected, that
one of your methods is better than the other. 
6. A code directory with clearly labeled files and/or
  directories showing
      + Some common _base_
      + Code for three different solutions.

## Grading

+ Presentation: 10 marks.
+ Essay
    + 5 marks for overall presentation
    + 5 marks for the quality and clarity
      of the argue that demonstrating that
      one method is better than the other
