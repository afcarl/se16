# Report Format

Reports must be written in pdf format, generated from Word or Latex.

If you want to use Latex, and if you want to avoid
all the installation problems, use
Sharelatex[^sharelatex].

For Latex, and Word, template files can be found
[here](http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html). Note that the file should be uses as is,
without changes to margins or font sizes or line
spacings.
[See here for a sample](https://github.com/LambdaConglomerate/x9115lam/blob/master/paper/paper.pdf),
which is generated from
[these files](https://github.com/LambdaConglomerate/x9115lam/tree/master/paper).



[^sharelatex]: (A) Open a Sharelatex.com account
using your Github id.
(B) Create a "New Project"
from template "Journal > ACM SIG Proceedings
Templates".
(C) Link that to Github (which will
create a new repo, just for that paper)

Remember that all figures need captions and should
be mentioned in the text. References should be
numbered and listed at the end of the paper.
