# Mar1 Project 

[TOC]

# Goals
1. To implement three different solutions to the
  problem identified in January
2. To implement the telemetry (data collection)
  required to assess if any of these three actually
  matter. 
3. To learn distributed project methods using Github.
4. To plan the March work
5. To start collecting data for the April project.

## What NOT to Do

+ January was finding a problem
+ February (this month) is building candidate solutions
+ March will be testing those solutions.
+ And April will be building tools to reflect on how
  effective are teams at building software.

So this month is all about _building tools_, not
_trials_ of these tools. You succeed this month if
some code is running (and not that it has been
tested on some sample population).

Next month (March) expect dramatic changes
to your code base when your user trials start and
you realize that you should be doing XYZ not ABC.
So be prepared to be _very_ agile in March.



## What to Hand it

To our [submission spreadsheet](https://goo.gl/kOunui)
paste in a _shortened_ [^shorter] url to a README.md file with _labeled_ links to

1. Your repo's issues pages.
2. Your repo's milestone pages.
3. Your repo's [contributor's page](https://github.com/opensciences/opensciences.github.io/graphs/contributors).
4. A log of sample output from your telemetry
5. [From the demos sign-up page](https://goo.gl/PP7KpF)
list your demo time where you will show 3 solutions
working and walk through your demo code.
6. A code directory with clearly labeled files and/or
  directories showing
      + Some common _base_
      + Code for three different solutions.
7. An evaluation plan (for how you will assess if
   any (all) of the above is actually useful. Note
   this will be your March work.

## Grading

+ 2 marks per solution:
       + One mark if it is sort of there,
       + Another mark if it actually works.
+ 2 marks for the telemetry:
       + One mark if it is sort of there,
       + Another mark if there are some large logs showing that it can
  collect data, in practice.
+ 2 marks if your Github repo is _active_; i.e.
       + Contains dozens to hundreds of commits and issues;
       + All issues are in five to twenty (or more) milestones;
       + Issues are labeled;
       + Issues are getting opened and closed;
       + (Some) milestones are getting completed (but others might actually be your plan
  for your March work).
       + All members of the team are contributing equally
  (plus or minus 50%).

For a sample of possibly useful labels, see
[a simple styleguide for tagging Github issues](https://robinpowered.com/blog/best-practice-system-for-organizing-and-tagging-github-issues/).

As to milestones, that is up to you and your team
and the demands of your project.
