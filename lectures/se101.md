# What is Software Engineering?

# What Does Software Do?

Software engineers build and control the software that
controls the world:

+ Silicon valley developers view every new feature
  as an experiment, to be tested within some mash
  up.
+ Chemists win Nobel Prize for software sims
  [http://goo.gl/p8YScA](http://goo.gl/p8YScA);
+ Engineers use software to optical tweezers, radiation therapy, remote sensing,  chip design,  [http://goo.gl/qBMyIZ](http://goo.gl/qBMyIZ);
+ Web analysts use software to analyze clickstreams
  to improve sales and marketing strategies;
  [http://goo.gl/b26CfY](http://goo.gl/b26CfY)
+ Stock traders write software to simulate trading
  strategies [http://www.quantopian.com](http://www.quantopian.com);
+ Analysts write software to mine labor statistics
  data to review proposed gov policies
  [http://goo.gl/X4kgnc](http://goo.gl/X4kgnc);
+ Journalists use software to analyze economic data,
  make visualizations of their news stories
  [http://fivethirtyeight.com](http://fivethirtyeight.com);
+ In London or New York, ambulances wait for your
  call at a location determined by a software model
  [http://goo.gl/8SMd1p](http://goo.gl/8SMd1p);
+ Etc etc etc  

Software literally controls what we think about the
world around us:

+ Eli Pariser:
      + <em>As web companies strive to tailor their
        services (including news and search results)
        to our personal tastes, there's a dangerous
        unintended consequence: We get trapped in a
        "filter bubble" and don't get exposed to
        information that could challenge or broaden
        our worldview.</em>
+ E.g. at the height of the Arab spring riots in Cairo,
  two people search for "Egypt"
     + One gets to see the riots;
     + The other gets to see pretty pictures of tourist attractions.

# So What Do Software Engineers Do?

Software Engineering is the:

+ process of the
+ design,
+ construction and
+ maintenance of
+ good enough
+ software,
+ given the available resources.

The last point means that we are always trading off
between what we want with what we need with what
we've got. Software engineers, therefore are the
people we look to:

+ Make and
+ justify
+ well-informed decisions
+ about trade-offs
+ in software engineering.

This, in turn means that at any time, software
engineering are aware of multiple possibilities and
the reasons why we should be doing one, and not the
others.

Parts of SE:

- requirements;
- architecture;
- process (life cycle);
- risk management;
- patterns, anti-patterns, bad smells;
- construction;
- verification;
- programming languages and databases.

# Why Software is so Interesting... Now

# The Great Secret

+ Software = 1/3 planning (requirements, design)
+ 1/6th coding,
+ 1/4 unit test,
+ 1/4 system test

<center><img  width=600 src="/_img/vmodel.png"></center>

Surprised that testing takes half the time?

- Maurice Wikes, 1949
     - "I well remember when this realization first came
       on me with full force."
	 - "The EDSAC was on the top
       floor of the building and the tape-punching and
       editing equipment one floor below..."
     - "It was on one of my journeys between the
        EDSAC room and the punching equipment that
        "hesitating at the angles of stairs" the
        realization came over me with full force
        that a good part of the remainder of my life
        was going to be spent in finding errors in
        my own programs."

# Predictions for the Future

[IDC Predictions 2015: Accelerating Innovation- and Growth-
 on the 3rd Platform](/_img/IDCForecast2015.pdf),
Frank Gens, IDC Predictions 2015 Team.

+ Worldwide IT and telecom spending, exceeding $3.8
  trillion in 2015.
+ Smartphone and tablet spending will hit $484
  billion, generating 40% of all IT growth.
+ The greater cloud market will hit $118 billion,
  growing to over $200 billion by 2018.
+ The overall big data and analytics market will
  reach $125 billion worldwide.
+ In 2015, China will account for 43% of all ICT
  spending growth, one-third of all smartphone
  purchases, and about one-third of all online
  shoppers.
+ The innovation stage will also be driven by a new wave of core technologies — innovation accelerators — that radically extend the 3rd Platform's capabilities and applications, including:
     + The Internet of Things: A massive expansion of the edge, to "smart" cars, buildings, homes, industrial equipment, wearables, and more
     + Cognitive systems: Systems that observe, learn, analyze, offer suggestions, and even create new ideas — dramatically reshaping every services industry
     + Pervasive robotics: Driving knowledge from the digital world into action in the physical world, through robots, self-driving cars, drones, nanorobots, and more
     + 3D printing of all kinds: Materializing all sorts of physical things from digital blueprints — from food to clothing to eventually even living tissue and organs
     + Natural interfaces: More simply and powerfully
connecting people and 3rd Platform systems — through
speech, vision, motion, touch, and beyond
     + Cloud-based "3rd Platform"–optimized security
technologies and solutions: Better designed to keep
up with the massive scale and expanding scope of the
3rd Platform
