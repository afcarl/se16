# What Does Software Do?

Software engineers build and control the software that
controls the world:

+ Silicon valley developers view every new feature
  as an experiment, to be tested within some mash
  up.
+ Chemists win Nobel Prize for software sims
  [http://goo.gl/p8YScA](http://goo.gl/p8YScA);
+ Engineers use software to optical tweezers, radiation therapy, remote sensing,  chip design,  [http://goo.gl/qBMyIZ](http://goo.gl/qBMyIZ);
+ Web analysts use software to analyze clickstreams
  to improve sales and marketing strategies;
  [http://goo.gl/b26CfY](http://goo.gl/b26CfY)
+ Stock traders write software to simulate trading
  strategies [http://www.quantopian.com](http://www.quantopian.com);
+ Analysts write software to mine labor statistics
  data to review proposed gov policies
  [http://goo.gl/X4kgnc](http://goo.gl/X4kgnc);
+ Journalists use software to analyze economic data,
  make visualizations of their news stories
  [http://fivethirtyeight.com](http://fivethirtyeight.com);
+ In London or New York, ambulances wait for your
  call at a location determined by a software model
  [http://goo.gl/8SMd1p](http://goo.gl/8SMd1p);
+ Etc etc etc  

Software literally controls what we think about the
world around us:

+ Eli Pariser:
      + <em>As web companies strive to tailor their
        services (including news and search results)
        to our personal tastes, there's a dangerous
        unintended consequence: We get trapped in a
        "filter bubble" and don't get exposed to
        information that could challenge or broaden
        our worldview.</em>
+ E.g. at the height of the Arab spring riots in Cairo,
  two people search for "Egypt"
     + One gets to see the riots;
     + The other gets to see pretty pictures of tourist attractions.

# So What Do Software Engineers Do?

Software Engineering is the:

+ process of the
+ design,
+ construction and
+ maintenance of
+ good enough
+ software,
+ given the available resources.

The last point means that we are always trading off
between what we want with what we need with what
we've got. Software engineers, therefore are the
people we look to:

+ Make and
+ justify
+ well-informed decisions
+ about trade-offs
+ in software engineering.

This, in turn means that at any time, software
engineering are aware of multiple possibilities and
the reasons why we should be doing one, and not the
others.

Parts of SE:

- requirements;
- architecture;
- process (life cycle);
- risk management;
- patterns, anti-patterns, bad smells;
- construction;
- verification;
- programming languages and databases.

The highest-level picture of traditional SE:

+ Software = 1/3 planning (requirements, design)
+ 1/6th coding,
+ 1/4 unit test,
+ 1/4 system test
