# Some Process Notes

Software development costs (from Brookes' Mythical Man Month[^brooks75] text).

+ 1/3 planning (requirements, design);
+ 1/6th coding;
+ 1/4 unit test (testing code written by one programmer);
+ 1/4 system test (test code assemblies built by _"N"_ programmers).

# Waterfall

The following notes come from
[blogs/invisiblethread](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/invisiblethread/entry/beyond_devops_distributedops_noops_and_bizdevops?lang=en).

In the beginning was the
[waterfall model](/resources/70waterfall.pdf):

Royce 70's critique of waterfall[^royce70]:

+  "Unfortunately,  design iterations are never confined to the successive steps."
+  i.e. later tests can lead to changes to document very much upstream.

His solution? More documentation!

+  Write an overview document that is understandable,
   informative and current. Each and every worker
   must have an elemental understanding of the
   system. At least one person must have a deep
   understanding of the system which comes partially
   from having had to write an overview document.
+  How much documentation?" My own view is "quite a
   lot;" certainly more than most programmers,
   analysts, or program designers are willing to do
   if left to their own devices.

Advantages of Agile model (from [http://goo.gl/n33v09](http://goo.gl/n33v09)):

+ Customer satisfaction by rapid, continuous delivery of useful software.
+ People and interactions are emphasized rather than
  process and tools. Customers, developers and
  testers constantly interact with each other.
+ Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months).
+ Face-to-face conversation is a productive form of communication.
+ Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.
+ Continuous attention to technical details and good design.
+ Regular adaptation to changing circumstances.
+ Even late changes in requirements are welcomed

Disadvantages of Agile model
(from [http://goo.gl/n33v09](http://goo.gl/n33v09)):

+ In case of some software deliverables, especially
  the large ones, it is difficult to assess the
  effort required at the beginning of the software
  development life cycle.
+ There is lack of emphasis on necessary designing
  and documentation.
+ The project can easily get taken off track if the
  customer representative is not clear what final
  outcome that they want.
+ Only senior programmers are capable of taking the
  kind of decisions required during the development
  process. Hence it can be harder for newbies to be agile,
  unless combined with experienced
  resources.
