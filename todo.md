## on design (and the need for feedback)

Just about 20% of the features implemented in a software product are often or always used, while 64% of the features get rarely or never used [6]. This means that substantial development effort is wasted. But even worse: it means that maintenance cost of the product (constituting the majority of the total product effort) is higher than needed. This often implies delays in delivering products or lack of quality

## testing less

track what was effective at finding bugs. test those more.
